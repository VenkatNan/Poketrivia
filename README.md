    While making this app, I made sure I planned out what exactly I wanted to do, and what the minimum viable product(MVP) was.
    I had exams the entire first week of the project, and because of that I wanted to make sure I had a good base so I could complete the project on time.

## Icebox
---
    * I wanted Users to have hints
    * A timer, where users get more points the quicker they answer
    * three levels with rising difficulty. each level has a different set of pokemon.
    * players have to know types and moves, not just names.
